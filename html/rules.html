<h2>Rules:</h2><br>
#0. Listen to the fucking admins.
<br>
#1. Play the role you have chosen, and play it well. No knowledge you shouldn't have, no respawning as dead people, ecetera.
<br>
#2. Don't be a powergaming twat. Always going for the best gear, doing chemistry or research as someone who should by no means be capable of doing such things, that's powergaming.
<br>
#3. Only Legion and NCR can kill each other on sight. You have to say "THIS IS A ROBBERY CUNT" as a wastelander if you want to kill someone. When in doubt if you can KoS, just don't.
<br>
#4. ERP's allowed, but if you're being a freakazoid about it the admins have free reign to abuse you. Player complaints and awful /mes make this more likely to occur.
